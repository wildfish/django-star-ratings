Python 3 compatible ratings for Django.

Add ratings to any Django model with a template tag.

See full `documentation
<http://django-star-ratings.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest/>`_.

Built by Wildfish. https://wildfish.com

Requirements
============

* Python 3.6+.
* Django 2.2+


Installation
============

Install from PyPI:

::

    pip install django-star-ratings

add ``star_ratings`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``:

::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'star_ratings'
    )

sync your database:

::

    python manage.py migrate

add the following to your urls.py:

::

    path('ratings/', include('star_ratings.urls', namespace='ratings')),

Make sure ``'django.core.context_processors.request',`` is in
``TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS``.

Usage
=====

Add the following javascript and stylesheet to your template

::

    {% load static %}
    <html>
    ...
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'star-ratings/css/star-ratings.css' %}">
    <script type="text/javascript" src="{% static 'star-ratings/js/dist/star-ratings.min.js' %}"></script>
    ...
    </html>

To enable ratings for a model add the following tag in your template

::

    {% load ratings %}
    <html>
    ...
    {% ratings object %}
    ...
    </html>

Template tags
=============

The template tag takes four arguments:

-  ``icon_height``: defaults to ``STAR_RATINGS_STAR_HEIGHT``
-  ``icon_width``: defaults to ``STAR_RATINGS_STAR_WIDTH``
-  ``read_only``: overrides the ``editable`` behaviour to make the widget read only
-  ``template_name``: overrides the tempalte to use for the widget

Settings
========

To prohibit users from altering their ratings set
``STAR_RATINGS_RERATE = False`` in settings.py

To allow users to delete a rating by selecting the same score again, set
``STAR_RATINGS_RERATE_SAME_DELETE = True`` in settings.py, note
that ``STAR_RATINGS_RERATE`` must be True if this is set.

To allow uses to delete a rating via a clear button, set
``STAR_RATINGS_CLEARABLE = True``` in settings.py. This can be used
with or without STAR_RATINGS_RERATE.

To change the number of rating stars, set ``STAR_RATINGS_RANGE``
(defaults to 5)

To enable anonymous rating set ``STAR_RATINGS_ANONYMOUS = True``.

Please note that ``STAR_RATINGS_RERATE``, ``STAR_RATINGS_RERATE_SAME_DELETE`` and  ``STAR_RATINGS_CLEARABLE``
will have no affect when anonymous rating is enabled.

Anonymous Rating
================

If anonymous rating is enabled only the ip address for the rater will be stored (even if the user is logged in).
When a user rates an object a preexisting object will not be searched for, instead a new rating object will be created

**If this value is changed your lookups will return different results!**

To control the default size of stars in pixels set the values of ``STAR_RATINGS_STAR_HEIGHT`` and
``STAR_RATINGS_STAR_WIDTH``. By default ``STAR_RATINGS_STAR_WIDTH`` is the same as
``STAR_RATINGS_STAR_HEIGHT`` and ``STAR_RATINGS_STAR_HEIGHT`` defaults to 32.


Changing the star graphics
==========================

To change the star graphic, add a sprite sheet to
``/static/star-ratings/images/stars.png`` with the states aligned
horizontally. The stars should be laid out in three states: full, empty
and active.

You can also set ``STAR_RATINGS_STAR_SPRITE`` to the location of your sprite sheet.

Customize widget template
=========================

You can customize ratings widget by creating ``star_ratings/widget.html``. For example :

::

    {% extends "star_ratings/widget_base.html" %}
    {% block rating_detail %}
    Whatever you want
    {% endblock %}

See ``star_ratings/widget_base.html`` for other blocks to be extended.

Ordering by ratings
===================

The easiest way to order by ratings is to add a ``GenericRelation`` to
the ``Rating`` model from your model:

::

    from django.contrib.contenttypes.fields import GenericRelation
    from star_ratings.models import Rating

    class Foo(models.Model):
        bar = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        ratings = GenericRelation(Rating, related_query_name='foos')

    Foo.objects.filter(ratings__isnull=False).order_by('ratings__average')

Custom Rating Model
===================

In some cases you may need to create your own rating model. This is possible
by setting ``STAR_RATING_RATING_MODEL`` in your settings file. This can be useful
to add additional fields or methods to the model. This is very similar to the how
django handles swapping the user model
(see [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/auth/customizing/#substituting-a-custom-user-model]).

For ease ``AbstractBaseRating`` is supplied. For example if you wanted to add the
field ``foo`` to the rating model you would need to crate your rating model
extending ``AbstractBaseRating``:

::

   ./myapp/models.py

   class MyRating(AbstractBaseRating):
      foo = models.TextField()

And add the setting to the setting file:

::

   ./settings.py

   ...
   STAR_RATINGS_RATING_MODEL = 'myapp.MyRating'
   ...

**NOTE:** If you are using a custom rating model there is an issue with how django
migration handles dependency orders. In order to create your initial migration you
will need to comment out the ``STAR_RATINGS_RATING_MODEL`` setting and run
``makemigrations``. After this initial migration you will be able to add the setting
back in and run ``migrate`` and ``makemigrations`` without issue.

Changing the ``pk`` type (Requires django >= 1.10)
==================================================

One use case for changing the rating model would be to change the pk type of the
related object. By default we assume the pk of the rated object will be a
positive integer field which is fine for most uses, if this isn't though you will
need to override the ``object_id`` field on the rating model as well as set
STAR_RATINGS_OBJECT_ID_PATTERN to a reasonable value for your new pk field. As
of django 1.10 you can now hide fields form parent abstract models, so to change
the ``object_id``to a ``CharField`` you can do something like:

::

   class MyRating(AbstractBaseRating):
      object_id = models.CharField(max_length=10)

And add the setting to the setting file:

::

   ./settings.py

   ...
   STAR_RATINGS_OBJECT_ID_PATTERN = '[a-z0-9]{32}'
   ...


Events
======

Some events are dispatched from the javascript when an object is raised. Each
event that ias dispatched has a ``details`` property that contains information
about the object and the rating.

``rate-success``
----------------

Dispatched after the user has rated an object and the display has been updated.

The event details contains

::

    {
        sender: ... // The star DOM object that was clicked
        rating: {
            average: ... // Float giving the updated average of the rating
            count: ... // Integer giving the total number of ratings
            percentage: ... // Float giving the percentage rating
            total: ... // Integer giving the sum of all ratings
            user_rating: ... // Integer giving the rating by the user
    }

``rate-failed``
---------------

Dispatched after the user has rated an object but the server responds with an error.

The event details contains

::

    {
        sender: ... // The star DOM object that was clicked
        error: ... // String giving the error message from the server
    }


Running tests
-------------

To run the test use:

::

    $> ./runtests.py
